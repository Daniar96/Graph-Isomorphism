## Run the project
### To run basic instances
- Run automorphism_counter.py 
- Provide a path either to a file or a directory of a graph
- If a path to directory was provided, the directory will be scanned, files with .grl and .gr will be processed 

### To run fast part refinement
- Run fastPartitionRefinement.py
- In setup() function add path to the required file (graph-path variable)
